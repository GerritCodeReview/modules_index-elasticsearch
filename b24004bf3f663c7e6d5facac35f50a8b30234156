Is there a good place to document that for ES since I think we don\u0027t have ES releasenotes?",

I think adding the Release-Notes footer is a good start if we want to start compiling release notes for this module going forward. https://gerrit.googlesource.com/homepage is probably a good place to add release notes once we deciede to start making releases.",
